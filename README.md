## Bioacoustic data compression

This repository is used to create a array spectrograms from any audio format (mp3, flac, ogg, aac) of animal vocalizations to train a CNN classifier for bioacoustic monitoring project.
The objective is to be able to evaluate how well a classifier along the compressed data using all available data compression techniques perform compared with the original data. 
The data is always saved as a waveform (.wav). You can use any tools to convert the data but here we are created our own converter to facilitate the transformation of ultiples files in one click. This app is created with PyQt5.
